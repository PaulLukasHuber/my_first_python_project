# Simple Sales and Income Calculator

**Short Description:** This Python project calculates the net income of a small business by tracking sales data and factoring in expenses.

**Breakdown:**

- Sales Tracking: The code maintains a dictionary (sales_data) to store sales figures for different products (e.g., Bubblegum, Ice Cream).
- Income Calculation: It calculates the total income by summing up the sales of all items.
- Expense Input: The code prompts the user to input staff expenses and other operational costs.
- Net Income: Finally, it determines the net income by subtracting the expenses from the total income.

**How to Use:**

- Replace the placeholder values in the sales_data dictionary with your actual sales figures.
- Run the code.
- Enter your staff expenses and other expenses when prompted.
